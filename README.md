# COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project involves an analysis of a COVID-19 dataset using Python. The dataset includes key statistics such as the number of cases, recovered cases, deaths per region, etc.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to study and understand the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across different regions. This is achieved through the application of various data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Key Features
1. **Data Analysis**: Utilized Python to perform an analysis of the COVID-19 dataset. The dataset includes statistics such as the number of cases and deaths per region, along with other statisitics.

2. **Supervised Learning**: Applied supervised learning techniques including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression to analyze the data. These techniques helped in predicting and understanding the trends in the data.

3. **Unsupervised Learning**: Implemented unsupervised learning through clustering to identify patterns in the pandemicâ€™s spread. This helped in understanding the behavior of the virus and its spread pattern across different regions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
